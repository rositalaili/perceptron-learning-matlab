# Implementing a Perceptron Learning Algorithm in Matlab

This repository contains perceptron and multi-perceptron algorithms implemented in matlab accompanied by a graphic user interface as an interactive form. The data used is a matrix form of letter image as a classification task. The algorithm explains the mechanism of perceptron learning in simple terms.
